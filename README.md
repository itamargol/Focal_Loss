# Focal_Loss

Keras implementation for focal loss function.

Great mathematical solution for optimizing scenarios of unbalanced-classes.
Focal loss down-weights the well-classified examples (boosting-like concept). 
This has the net effect of putting more training emphasis on that data that is hard to classify.
